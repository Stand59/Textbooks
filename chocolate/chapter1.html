        <h2>1.1 From Bean to Beverage</h2>
        <p>
          Chocolate’s story begins thousands of years ago in Central and South
          America, where ancient civilizations like the Maya and Aztec
          cultivated cacao trees. They transformed the bitter cacao beans into a
          spiced, frothy drink enjoyed by nobles and warriors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This early chocolate was nothing like today’s sweet treat—it was
          unsweetened, often mixed with chili peppers and maize for a bold,
          energizing drink.

        <h2>1.2 The Journey to Europe</h2>
        <p>
          When Spanish explorers encountered cacao in the 16th century, they
          brought it back to Europe. There, sugar and cinnamon were added,
          turning chocolate into a luxurious beverage for the wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, innovations in processing made chocolate more accessible,
          setting the stage for the solid chocolate bars we enjoy today.
